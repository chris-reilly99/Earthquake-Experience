<h1 style= "color:#883030">The Idea/Description</h1>
<p align= "center">

This application allows you to view earthquakes around the world for the past 30 days.  Data 
is displayed using an ESRI map and the data comes from the USGS.  In addition, the user is able
to click on an earthquake to see more information about it.  If the user is logged in, they 
can leave a comment about the earthquake and say whether or not they felt it.  This data is
then displayed for all users to see. A chart displays the top 10 earthquakes.  This information
is currently supplied by a hard-coded json file.
